`JIGSAW(GEO)` is a set of algorithms designed to generate unstructured grids for geoscientific modelling. Applications include: large-scale atmospheric simulation and numerical weather prediction, global and coastal ocean-modelling, and ice-sheet dynamics. 

`JIGSAW(GEO)` can be used to produce high-quality 'generalised' Delaunay / Voronoi tessellations for unstructured finite-volume / element type models. Grids can be generated in local two-dimensional domains, and over general spheroidal surfaces. Mesh resolution can be adapted to follow complex user-defined metrics, including: topographic contours, discrete solution profiles or coastal features. This enables the construction of complex, multi-resolution climate process models, with simulation fidelity enhanced in regions of interest.

`JIGSAW(GEO)` is typically able to produce the very high-quality staggered unstructured grids required by contemporary unstructued general circulation models (i.e. <a href="https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Release">`MPAS`</a>, <a href="https://research.csiro.au/cem/software/ems/hydro/unstructured-compas/">`COMPAS`</a>, <a href="http://fesom.de/">`FESOM`</a>, etc), generating highly optimised, multi-resolution meshes that are `locally-orthogonal`, `mutually-centroidal` and `self-centred`.

`JIGSAW(GEO)` depends on the <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-matlab">`JIGSAW-MATLAB`</a> package; a `MATLAB` / `OCTAVE` interface to the underlying `JIGSAW` meshing library.

### `Quickstart`

`JIGSAW(GEO)` requires the `JIGSAW` meshing package be installed and available on the `MATLAB` / `OCTAVE` path. `JIGSAW`'s `MATLAB` / `OCTAVE` interface is available <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-matlab">here</a>. Once installed, the test problems can be run via:

    Clone/download + unpack this repository.
    From MATLAB / OCTAVE:
    Ensure JIGSAW-MATLAB is installed and available on the path.
    Run example.m

Note: installation of `JIGSAW` requires a `c++` compiler and the `cmake` utility. `JIGSAW` may also be installed as a `conda` package. See <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw">here</a> for details.

### `Example Problems`

The following set of example problems are available in `example.m`:

    example(1); % generate a uniform resolution global grid
    example(2); % generate a regionally-refined global grid
    example(3); % build smooth mesh-spacing functions from noisy input data
    example(4); % generate a complex, variable resolution global grid
    example(5); % generate structured icosahedral and cubedsphere meshes
    example(6); % generate a coastal mesh for the Australasian region
    example(7); % generate a multi-part mesh for the (contiguous) USA
